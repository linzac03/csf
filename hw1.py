### Problem 1
###

print "Problem 1 solution follows:"

# x2-5.86 x+ 8.5408
a = 1
b = -5.86
c = 8.5408

root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(b ** 2 - 4 * a * c))/2 * a
root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(b ** 2 - 4 * a * c))/2 * a

print root1
print root2

print "Problem 2 solution follows:"

import hw1_test
print hw1_test.a
print hw1_test.b
print hw1_test.c
print hw1_test.d
print hw1_test.e
print hw1_test.f

###
### Problem 3

print "Problem 3 solution follows:"

boo = ((hw1_test.a and hw1_test.b) or (not hw1_test.c) and not (hw1_test.d or hw1_test.e or hw1_test.f))
print str(boo)
